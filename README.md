# Christopher Woodyard | Founder + CEO, Vers3Dynamics

hi. I’m Christopher Woodyard, founder of **Vers3Dynamics**, where I explore how technology, resonance, and symbolic systems shape human experience and perception. My focus is on building apps that help us better understand the unseen structures that guide cognition, behavior, and belief.

## Areas of Interest

- Cognitive phase space modeling  
- Cymatics and frequency-based wellness  
- Chrono-spatial geometry and symbolic feedback  
- genAI systems for perception, resonance, and adaptation  
- Post-symbolic UX and ambient intelligence  

## Guiding Ideas

- Reality reflects structure beneath the visible.  
- Symbols are more than language—they're forces.  
- Resonance isn't metaphorical—it's foundational.
