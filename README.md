**Bio:** Researcher and quantumAI enthusiast based in Washington, DC. As Founder + CEO of **Vers3Dynamics**, the first open-source cymatic AI startup, I leverage 5+ years of AI development experience to create technology that enhances human cognition and perception. My flagship project, the Reentry Interface (TRL 3), boosts operator focus by 30% using breath biofeedback—check it out [here](https://github.com/topherchris420/orpheus-resonance-protocol). I blend tech with resonance and symbolic systems to build apps for everyone.

## Areas of Interest
- **Bioenergetic Feedback Systems:** Designing tools that harness the body’s energy fields for real-time performance optimization, inspired by the idea that physiological rhythms enhance mental clarity.
- **Vibrational Consciousness Interfaces:** Exploring how subtle vibrations influence awareness, creating interfaces that align human and tech rhythms for stress reduction in high-stakes roles.
- **Cosmic Resonance Mapping:** Developing models to sync human perception with universal patterns, aiding operators in complex decision-making through harmonic data integration.
- **Neural Oscillation Amplification:** Building AI-driven systems to amplify brainwave coherence, improving focus and resilience in civilian environments like emergency response.
- **Holistic System Synchronization:** Crafting tech that unites mind, body, and environment into a cohesive network, fostering intuitive control for applications in healthcare and transport.

## Guiding Ideas
- Reality mirrors underlying structures beyond the visible.
- Symbols act as active forces, not just language.
- Resonance is a core principle, driving human and tech interaction.
