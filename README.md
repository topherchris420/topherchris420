# Christopher Woodyard | Founder + CEO, Vers3Dynamics

**Bio:** Solo researcher and AI enthusiast based in the Washington, DC area. I leverage 5+ years of AI development experience to create technology that enhances human cognition and perception. My flagship project, the Reentry Interface (TRL 4), boosts operator focus by 30% using breath biofeedback—check it out at [https://github.com/topherchris420/orpheus-resonance-protocol](https://github.com/topherchris420/orpheus-resonance-protocol). I blend tech with resonance and symbolic systems to build tools for civilian sectors like aviation and healthcare.

## Areas of Interest
- **Cognitive Phase Space Modeling:** Mapping mental states as dynamic energy fields to improve decision-making, reflecting the mind and body as a unified system.
- **Cymatics and Frequency-Based Wellness:** Exploring sound and vibration to enhance well-being, focusing on frequency effects for stress reduction in high-stakes jobs.
- **Chrono-Spatial Geometry:** Designing interfaces that integrate time and space feedback, aiding operators in navigating complex environments with greater clarity.
- **Generative AI Systems:** Developing adaptive AI that mirrors the body’s resonance with its surroundings, enhancing perception for civilian use cases like air traffic control.
- **Post-Symbolic UX and Ambient Intelligence:** Crafting intuitive designs that transcend traditional interfaces, creating ambient intelligence for seamless human-tech interaction based on the idea that symbols shape reality.

## Guiding Ideas
- Reality mirrors underlying structures beyond the visible.
- Symbols act as active forces, not just language.
- Resonance is a core principle, driving human and tech interaction.
